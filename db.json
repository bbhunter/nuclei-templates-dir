The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.","tags":"cve,cve2020,kev,tenable,apache,lfi,network,tomcat,ajp","path":"network/cves/2020/CVE-2020-1938.yaml"},{"author":"johnk3r","id":"ws_ftp-ssh-detect","name":"WS_FTP-SSH Service - Detect","severity":"info","description":"WS_FTP-SSH service was detected.\n","tags":"network,ssh,ws_ftp,detect,progress","path":"network/detection/ws_ftp-ssh-detect.yaml"},{"author":"geeknik","id":"detect-jabber-xmpp","name":"Jabber XMPP Protocol - Detect","severity":"info","description":"Jabber XMPP protocol was detected.","tags":"network,jabber,xmpp,messaging,detect","path":"network/detection/detect-jabber-xmpp.yaml"},{"author":"pussycat0x","id":"ibm-d2b-database-server","name":"IBM DB2 Database Server - Detect","severity":"info","description":"IBM DB2 Database Server panel was detected.\n","tags":"network,ibm,database,db,db2,detect","path":"network/detection/ibm-d2b-database-server.yaml"},{"author":"johnk3r","id":"moveit-sftp-detect","name":"MOVEit Transfer SFTP - Detect","severity":"info","description":"MOVEit Transfer SFTP was detected.\n","tags":"network,ssh,detect,moveit,sftp","path":"network/detection/moveit-sftp-detect.yaml"},{"author":"pussycat0x","id":"iplanet-imap-detect","name":"iPlanet Messaging Server IMAP Protocol - Detection","severity":"info","description":"iPlanet Messaging Server IMAP protocol was detected.\n","tags":"network,imap,detect,iplanet","path":"network/detection/iplanet-imap-detect.yaml"},{"author":"pussycat0x","id":"activemq-openwire-transport-detect","name":"ActiveMQ OpenWire Transport Detection","severity":"info","description":"OpenWire is the native protocol that Apache ActiveMQ uses.

Zyxel NAS devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the Zyxel device. Although the web server does not run as the root user, Zyyxel devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable Zyyxel device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker.   However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices. For example, simply visiting a website can result in the compromise of any Zyyxel device that is reachable from the client system.
